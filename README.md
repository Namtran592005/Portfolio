## üöÄ Key Features

This project was built from scratch (Vanilla JS) to demonstrate a deep understanding of the web platform, featuring unique functionalities:

*   **üåê Multilingual Support:** Smoothly switch between multiple languages (Vietnamese, English, Japanese, Korean) without a page reload, using `JSON` and the `View Transitions API`.
*   **üåå GPU-Accelerated Starfield:** A 3D starfield background accelerated by the GPU (using `Three.js` and `GLSL shaders`) that moves with the mouse and reacts to music, optimized to have minimal impact on CPU performance.
*   **üéµ Advanced Audio Engine & Player:**
    *   A background music player with a playlist, shuffle/repeat modes.
    *   An advanced Web Audio API chain (EQ, Compressor, Limiter) for crisp and professional sound quality.
    *   Sound effects (SFX) for UI interactions.
*   **üé® Apple-Inspired UI:**
    *   A sophisticated "Glassmorphism" effect on cards and buttons.
    *   Light/Dark Mode toggle with a beautiful transition effect (`View Transitions API`).
    *   An iOS-style "Control Center" for quick access to settings.
*   **‚ú® Micro-interactions:**
    *   A "scramble" text effect during language switching.
    *   A light effect that follows the mouse cursor on interactive elements.
    *   Scroll-triggered animations using `IntersectionObserver`.
*   **üì± Comprehensive Optimization:**
    *   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Installable on the home screen and works offline.
    *   **SEO & Accessibility:** SEO-optimized with dynamic `JSON-LD`, `canonical` tags, and `meta` tags. `aria` attributes are used to improve accessibility.
    *   **Load Performance:** Utilizes `preload`, `loading="lazy"` for images/videos, and next-gen image formats (`.webp`, `.avif`).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Namtran592005/portfolio.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd portfolio
    ```
3.  **Run a local server:**
    Because this project uses ES Modules and a Service Worker, you must run it through a server. You cannot open the `index.html` file directly.
    *   **If you have VS Code:** Install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live".
    *   **If you have Python:**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
    *   **If you have Node.js:**
        ```bash
        npm install -g serve
        serve .
        ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to the local server address (usually `http://localhost:5500` or `http://localhost:8000`).
